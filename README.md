# real-estate-price-prediction

## DESCRIPTION

This project aims to create a Machine Learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium.

Task # 1 is to build a dataset gathering information about at least 10,000 properties all over Belgium.

After Stage 1, I have written up all the functions needed to extract the property information. However, I am only able to extract 229 locations because my `get-page-links` function can only extract the page links for page 1, 2, and 333 (last page) of *Apartment* pages and *House* pages respectively (6 pages total). I would still need to refine this function to extract all the page links between page 3 and page 332 (inclusive). 

## INSTALLATION

This project requires Python installation in a notebook of your choice. I recommend creating and activating a virtual environment.
