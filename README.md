# real-estate-price-prediction

## DESCRIPTION

This project aims to create a Machine Learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium.

Task # 1 is to build a dataset gathering information about at least 10,000 properties all over Belgium.

At the end of Task # 1, I have written up all the functions needed to extract the property information. However, I am only able to extract 760 locations because my `get-page-links` function can only extract the page links for the first 10 pages of *Apartment* pages and *House* pages respectively (20 pages total). I would still need to refine this function to extract all the page links. Another possibility is to extract only about the first 150 pages from *Apartment* and the first 150 pages from *House* to get to around 10,000 properties.

## INSTALLATION

This project can be accessed in a Python editor of your choice. I use `VSCode`. I recommend creating and activating a `virtual environment`.
